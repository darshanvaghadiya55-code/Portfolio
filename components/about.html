            <p class="about__text">
                I’m a web developer who enjoys building reliable, scalable, and well-structured web applications
                that solve real problems. I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code and creating systems
                that are easy to use, secure, and built to grow over time.
            </p>

            <p class="about__text">
                I began my journey during my academic years while pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications
                (BCA) at C. U. Shah University, where I graduated with a CGPA of 8.50 (2021–2024). Since then, I’ve worked
                on projects ranging from role-based platforms and RESTful APIs to payment systems and complex database
                architectures.
            </p>

            <p class="about__text">
                I enjoy working on products end to end, from designing database structures and APIs to shaping the final
                user experience. I’m particularly interested in building systems that are efficient behind the scenes
                while remaining simple and intuitive for users.
            </p>

            <p class="about__text">
                When I’m not coding, I like exploring new ideas, observing how products evolve, and learning from
                real-world systems and challenges. I believe consistency, curiosity, and long-term thinking are what
                make great developers.
            </p>

            <p class="about__text about__cta">
                I’m currently open to freelance opportunities and collaborations—feel free to reach out if you have an
                idea or a project in mind.
