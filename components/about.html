                <p class="small lh-lg animate animate--up delay-1">
                    I’m a web developer who enjoys building reliable, scalable, and well-structured web applications
                    that solve real problems. I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code and creating systems
                    that are easy to use, secure, and built to grow over time.
                </p>

                <p class="small lh-lg animate animate--up delay-2">
                    I began my journey during my academic years while pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer
                    Applications
                    (BCA) at C. U. Shah University, where I graduated with a CGPA of 8.50 (2021–2024). Since then, I’ve
                    worked
                    on projects ranging from role-based platforms and RESTful APIs to payment systems and complex
                    database
                    architectures.
                </p>

                <p class="small lh-lg animate animate--up delay-3">
                    I enjoy working on products end to end, from designing database structures and APIs to shaping the
                    final
                    user experience. I’m particularly interested in building systems that are efficient behind the
                    scenes
                    while remaining simple and intuitive for users.

                </p>

                <p class="small lh-lg animate animate--up delay-4">
                    When I’m not coding, I like exploring new ideas, observing how products evolve, and learning from
                    real-world systems and challenges. I believe consistency, curiosity, and long-term thinking are what
                    make great developers.
                </p>

                <p class="fw-medium mt-4 animate animate--up delay-5">
                    I’m currently open to freelance opportunities and collaborations—feel free to reach out if you have
                    an
                    idea or a project in mind.
